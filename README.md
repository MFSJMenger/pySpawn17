Features
========

This is a code performing multiple cloning in dense manifolds of states simulation written in python.  It is based on the pySpawn code, from which major parts od code are borrowed. However, there are significant algorithmic differences that it is impractical to keep the capabilities of both programs in the single package.  Right MCDMS has the following features:

-  Runs in the diabatic basis on test systems using cloning to a state procedure.
-  Instead of exact eigenstates, approximate eigenstates can be used (still testing). 
-  An analysis module for processing of simulation data.

This code is currently under development.
